# next things
- button to submit entry to database
- program keyboard behaviour for popup text fields
    - esc key resets to initial value
    - enter moves to next field? or does nothing? or immediately submits it?
    - tab definitely moves to next field, moving back to the top if last field

- parser runner needs logic to decide which parser to use
    - on non valid pages, it will do nothing
- popup needs to recieve data from parser runner and populate fields with it

- ~~make a page parser~~
