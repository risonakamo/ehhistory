# next things
- button to submit entry to database
- program keyboard behaviour for popup text fields
    - esc key resets to initial value
    - enter moves to next field? or does nothing? or immediately submits it?
    - tab definitely moves to next field, moving back to the top if last field

- ~~parser runner needs to return the type in the message sent back to the popup~~
- ~~popup needs to populate type field~~
- ~~parser runner needs logic to decide which parser to use~~
    - ~~on non valid pages, it will do nothing (as it wont have permission)~~
    - ~~popup should still allow user to manually fill in the fields and submit~~
- ~~popup needs to recieve data from parser runner and populate fields with it~~
- ~~make a page parser~~
